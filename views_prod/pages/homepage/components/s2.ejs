Scoreboard is exactly the same application as QuickScore but uses                a more generic business language in its menu structures. For example, where in QuickScore you might see the                balanced scorecard term Performance Measure in Scoreboard you will see the term KPI. With both Quickcore                and Scoreboard you can create really useful KPI Dashboards</p><a class="btn-lg btn" href="#">Scoreboard</a></div></div></section>
